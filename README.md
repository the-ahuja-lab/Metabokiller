## Introduction

Metabokiller is a carcinogen-independent ensemble model for carcinogenicity prediction. It is a novel ensemble classifier that accurately recognizes carcinogens by quantitatively assessing their chemical composition as well as potential to induce proliferation, oxidative stress, genotoxicity, alterations in epigenetic signatures, and activation of anti-apoptotic pathways.
